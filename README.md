## Motivation
Since the release of the game, I was fascinated by cool UI effects of the game but I wasn't aware of how does it works and it remained in my wishlist!
So,after a long long time I got the privilege to actually try to make one using the technologies out there! This project also helped me in learning and gaining expertise on the concepts of **Bootstrap** and **Javascript** and a lot of frameworks.
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* JQuery version-3.5.1
* Javascript
* Bootstrap version-4.5
* A *lot* of CSS Positioning
* Project initially had Popper.js files also but removed it as I didnt find any use of it 
## Features
* A unique _Scanline_ effect maintained all over the website
* HP and Level bars added at the footer and around the avatar same as the game
* Different effects added for active navs and other navs
* In weapons nav of INV tab, weapon stats for the respective weapon appear on the right as you hover on each
## To-do
* Add info in DATA, MAP, RADIO tabs
* Add image of weapons to be shown on hovering
* Update footer bar for different tabs
